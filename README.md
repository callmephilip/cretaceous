# deno-hono-vite-jsx

I started from this repo: <https://github.com/MathurAditya724/deno-vite-hono-jsx>

## Requirements

- NodeJS `22.x`
- Deno `2.2.8`
- PNPM `10.7.1`

## Install

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and for your sake, you should probably do that too.

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Build the client

Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Dev server

Run the `vite` dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Prod server

Run the `deno` prod server

```bash
deno run -A server/server.prod.ts
```
